# tg-mc-server
telegram bot to start and stop minecraft server

ALL SERVER FILES WILL BE STORED IN PROJECT FOLDER
???

before launch change vars:
tid (to your telegram id, https://t.me/getmyid_bot can help you in that)
bot (input your bot token from https://t.me/BotFather)
path (path to your mc-server jar-file) //idk but in theory it can work with other 'run-in-console' servers 
and maybe you want to change bot replies, Im too lazy to translate\comment it, sorry
:)
